Energy management involves monitoring energy usage and targeting energy saving oportunities. Reducing energy usage makes sense - it saves money, improves conmpetititiveness as well as reducing environmental impact. Energy management can be completed at low cost, but does require some time.

Monitoring  energy usage is vital for energy management since if you don't understand your energy usage then you can't prove whether your energy usage has increased or decreased. Targeting energy saving opportunities is how you can make energy and cost savings and it is very much a continuous and iterative process
