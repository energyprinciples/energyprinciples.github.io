# Energy Principles

## About
Energy Principles is a website about what you can do to save energy and money.

I’ve been working in this field for around three years, with a background in science. I pretty much learnt all the contents of this website from scratch in this time.

Throughout my career I’ve been on many courses, I’ve done plenty desk-based research and I’ve picked up all sorts of information through completing energy efficiency calculations and projects.

My reasoning for writing this website is partly from selfishness, trying to learn and remember everything, and partly my frustration with the lack of knowledge that is freely shared on the internet.

Feel free to use this site as a reference, guide or just for your interest. Please always cross-reference important information as human error is always possible.
