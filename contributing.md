# Contributions

We welcome contributions, enhancements or improvements to our documentation, which is hosted on the Energy Principles [GitHub](https://github.com/energyprinciples/energyprinciples.github.io/). While observing our contributions guidelines, you are free to fork any repository and create a pull request for your changes to be merged. In all cases the licence must remain in any derivatives of the work, and any contributions are assumed to be licensed under the same licence.

# Issues

If you find a mistake, bug or other problem, please [open an issue](https://github.com/energyprinciples/energyprinciples.github.io/issues) in this repository.

# Pull Requests

If you fix a mistake, bug or problem, or have something to contribute, please create a pull request for each modification. Please consider grouping modifications sensibly i.e. don't bundle typo fixes in the same pull request as code changes; instead, file them separately.

Please note that sometimes there are pedagogical reasons for certain style conventions. Changes which make sense from an engineering perspective, such as reducing duplication or making use of more advanced language, may not be suitable for maintaining the intended educational value of the material.
