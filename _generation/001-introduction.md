Almost everyone can consider generating energy, or at least storing energy to be used at a later date. How? Through ownership of a roof, building, land, river, lake, sea, waste food, waste heat or enough space for batteries.

For example:

Area | Technology
---- | ----
Roof | Solar PV, Solar thermal
Building | Air source heat pump, CHP, Biofuel
Land | Solar PV, Solar thermal, Wind, Ground source heat pump
River | Hydro
Lake | Water source heat pump
Sea | Wave power, Tidal power, Water source heat pump
Waste food | Anaerobic digestion
Waste heat | CHP, Evaporative cooling, Heat recovery

`T8` | `1 inch`
`T5` | `0.5 inch`

This section looks at all technologies that are involved with energy generation of some kind, or storage.
