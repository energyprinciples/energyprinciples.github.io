Almost everyone can consider generating energy, or at least storing energy to be used at a later date. How? Through ownership of a roof, building, land, river, lake, sea, waste food, waste heat or enough space for batteries.

For example:

Area | Technology
---- | ----
Roof | Solar PV, Solar thermal
Building | Air source heat pump, CHP, Biomass, Batteries
Land | Solar PV, Solar thermal, Wind, Ground source heat pump, Geothermal
River | Hydro
Lake | Water source heat pump
Sea | Wave power, Tidal power, Water source heat pump
Waste food | Anaerobic digestion
Waste heat | CHP, Evaporative cooling, Heat recovery

This section looks at all technologies that are involved with energy generation of some kind, or storage, including:
 - The National Grid energy generation
 - Energy distribution
 - Solar PV
 - Solar thermal
 - Wind power
 - Hydro power
 - Heat pumps
 - Geothermal
 - Wave and tidal power
 - Biomass
 - Biofuel
 - CHP
 - Heat recovery
 - Evaporative cooling
 - Batteries
 - Off-grid systems
 
 All of these topics will be covered as soon as I have the time, so please stay tuned!
