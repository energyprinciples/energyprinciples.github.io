# {{page.title}}

Solar photovoltaics (PV) are one of the most common forms of energy generation options for organisations and they provide a chance to become self-sufficient.

# Feed in Tarifs (FiTs) in the UK  

In the UK, to incentivise the development of renewables, FITs were brought in to help make solar PV financially viable and attractive.

Current, past and future predicted FITs are published by Ofgem on their website and are updated from time-to-time.

# The cost of Solar PV

Currently, the costs vary around £1,000/kW installed. The lowest quote I've seen has been around £750/kW, but there was a very good relationship between the supplier and customer.

Panels have to be MCS accredited to receive FITs *(need to check this).

Costs will vastly increase if any structural repairs need to be competed on your roof.

Costs will also increase if you need to increase the capacity of your electric meter.

# How much solar PV can I fit on my roof?

This of course primarily depends on the size of your roof and how much weight your roof can hold......

An average panel is approximately 250W and will need on average 1.6 m2. Therefore, 1kWp of Solar panels (4) will take up 6.4 m2 on your roof.

Note: Solar panels must not be any closer than 30 cm from any external roof edge.

# How to calculate solar panel yield

This is simple:
(kW rating of panel) x (solar irradiance for the area, inclination and orientation)*

*this can be found in the Irradiance Datasets on the Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS) website

# How to calculate solar PV return on investment

There are a few different factors that you need to consider…..


# Common questions


# What is the rough return on investment for Solar PV?

An average is roughly 9-10 years, however I've seen them as low as 6 years and as long as 15 years.

This depends on the solar panel yield, so elevation and orientation of the panels and where you are in the UK. It also depends on what sort of deal you get with your supplier, of course.

# My roof points east/west, is it worth considering Solar PV?

Yes.

If you do the calculations, this doesn't affect the yield too much.

It is far more important to ensure that there is no shade on the solar panels

# How often should I clean my Solar panels?

Every year ideally, preferably in the spring, to ensure that any old leaves are cleared and the array is nice and sparking ready for the summer months when solar yield will be much greater.

# How much solar PV can I fit on my roof?

This of course depends on the size of your roof and how much weight your roof can hold.

An average panel is approximately 250W and will need on average 1.6 m2. Therefore, 1kWp of Solar pannels (4) will take up 6.4 m2 on your roof.

Note: Solar panels must not be any closer than 30 cm from any external roof edge.

# Can I put Solar panels of a flat roof?

Yes. You will need to have your pannels mounted on a frame to elevate the angle from horrizontal to maximise the solar irradiation.
