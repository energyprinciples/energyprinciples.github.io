Replacing old lighting for newer, more efficient lighting is one of the most common energy efficient improvements in a building. Energy savings between 30-70% should be expected.

Benefits of looking at a new, efficient, lighting project are:

-	Energy and cost savings
-	More targeted lighting
-	Decreased lighting hours

To look at the benefits of replacing your lights, one of the first things you need to understand is how much energy you are using with your current lighting system. So, you need to understand what type of lamps you have, what is their wattage and how much do you use them.

## Types of lighting lamp:

There are four different types of light output:

1.	Incandescent – tungsten bulbs + halogens
2.	Discharge – fluorescent + metal halide etc.
3.	LED
4.	Induction – rarely seen, but actually quite efficient

### Tungsten bulbs 
These are generally quite inefficient, wasting a lot of energy through heat.

### Halogens 

### Compact Fluorescents

### Fluorescent tubes

Sizes of fluorescent tubes:
-	`T12` = `1.5 inch` = 
-	`T8` = `1` inch = 
-	`T5` = `0.5` inch = 

`T5s` have a higher light intensity than T8s and need a higher heat to give best light output (lumens)
-	You occasionally need to heat the fitting as a result
-	Due to kinetic theory

Fluorescent tubes have a triphosphor and a phosphor coating…
Ballasts = choke in US


### Metal halides

### Discharge lamps

### Induction lamps


## Calculating lighting energy savings

Once you know the type of lamp you can, you can estimate what you might potentially use. 

This should involve a mixture of more efficient lighting and better controls.

## Lighting glossary

* Lamp = the light source, often called a bulb
* Luminaire = the light fitting/fixture
* Ballast = often called the choke = part of a fuorescent light, causing the
* Lighting intensity (lux levels) = lighting level on a surface
*   `Lux=lm/m2`
* Lumens = light output
* Efficacy = `lumens/watts`
* Light Intensity = how far the light goes
* Light density = amount that gets reflected into your eyes (cd/m2)
* Light output ratio= what you get out of the fitting
* Luminous flux = light output ratio
* Reflectance = what is reflected
* Colour temperature = 
* Colour Rendering Index (CRI) = 
* Insert examples of different lights…
* See slide 8 for the W/m2 average power density

Suggested lux levels according to Building regulations, part L????:
-	Office – 500 lux
-	Computer room – 300 lux
-	
If staff are getting headaches, should install a warmer colour temperature bulb – more yellow.

## Use of daylight

-	Need ownership of rooms/spaces
-	Lux level is important=level of light
-	Occupancy hours is important
-	Check out new CIBSE guide on office lighting

## Importance of lighting design

## Types of lighting controls

Controlling lighting, whether it is old inefficient lighting or new lighting can reduce energy consumption of a lighting system.


### Types of movement sensors

There are a couple different types of movement sensors on the market, relying on movement to trigger a response. These include:
-	Passive Infra Red (PIR) sensors
-	Ultrasonic – look up
-	Microwave sensors

Passive Infra Red sensors
These are the most commonly used in commercial settings
