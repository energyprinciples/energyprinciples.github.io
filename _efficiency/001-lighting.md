# {{page.title}}

Replacing old lighting for newer, more efficient lighting is one of the most common energy efficient improvements in a building. Energy savings between 30-70% should be expected.

Benefits of looking at a new, efficient, lighting project are:

-	Energy and cost savings
-	More targeted lighting
-	Decreased lighting hours

To look at the benefits of replacing your lights, one of the first things you need to understand is how much energy you are using with your current lighting system. So, you need to understand what type of lamps you have, what is their wattage and how much do you use them.

# Types of lighting lamp:

There are four different types of light output:

1.	[Incandescent – tungsten bulbs + halogens](#1-incandescent-lamps)
2.	[Discharge – fluorescent + metal halide etc.](2-discharge-lamps)
3.	[Induction – rarely seen, but actually quite efficient](#3-induction-lamps)
4.	[LED – very efficient](#4-led)

## 1. Incandescent Lamps

Incandescnent lamps are based on electricity passing through a small filament, creating light and, as a side-product, heat.
The two most common types of incandescent lamps are tungsten bulbs and hallogens.

Tungsten bulbs are generally quite inefficient, wasting a lot of energy through heat. They also don't have a particularly long life span. They often darken with time, due to evaporated tungsten condensing on the inner surface of the glass. Basically, these should become a thing of the past.

Halogen lamps contain a filament within a halogen gas, which increases the lifetime of the bulb and precents dthe darkening of the bulb. They can operate at a slightly higher temperatures and as a result are better in confined spaces and are usually qute smal in size.

## 2. Discharge Lamps

There are several types of dischage lamps. Thes include fluorescent lamps, mercury vapour lamps, metal halide lamps, low pressure sodium lamps and SONs.

Compact Fluorescents

Fluorescent tubes

### Fluorescent tubes sizes

Tube Name | Size
---- | ----
`T12` | `1.5 inch`
`T8` | `1 inch`
`T5` | `0.5 inch`
{: .table }

> `T5` have a higher light intensity than `T8` and need a higher heat to give best light output (lumens), and you occasionally need to heat the `T5` fitting as a result due to kinetic theory.

Fluorescent tubes have a triphosphor and a phosphor coating…
Ballasts = choke in US 
Ballasts control the electricity going in to the fluorescent tube. They often use an additional 10% of electricity on top of the lamp wattage...    can have magnetic and electronic ballasts. Electronic ballasts....

Metal halides

Low pressure sodium lamps

SON lamps are

## 3. Induction lamps

## 4. LED

LEDs are the latest rage in terms of lighting and energy efficicency, more generally.
LED is an abbreviation of Light Emitting Diode. This means that

# Calculating lighting energy savings

Once you know the type of lamp you have, you can estimate what you might potentially use. 

This should involve a mixture of more efficient lighting and better controls.
Here is a link to my lighting calculations page:

Calculations look at: type of lamp, wattage, number of lamps and gives potential savings.

# Lighting glossary

* Lamp = the light source, often called a bulb
* Luminaire = the light fitting/fixture
* Ballast = often called the choke = part of a fuorescent light, causing the
* Lighting intensity (lux levels) = lighting level on a surface
*   `Lux=lm/m2`
* Lumens = light output
* Efficacy = `lumens/watts`
* Light Intensity = how far the light goes
* Light density = amount that gets reflected into your eyes (cd/m2)
* Light output ratio= what you get out of the fitting
* Luminous flux = light output ratio
* Reflectance = what is reflected
* Colour temperature = 
* Colour Rendering Index (CRI) = 
* Insert examples of different lights…
* See slide 8 for the W/m2 average power density

Suggested lux levels according to Building regulations, part L????:
-	Office – 500 lux
-	Computer room – 300 lux
-	
If staff are getting headaches, should install a warmer colour temperature bulb – more yellow.

# Use of daylight

-	Need ownership of rooms/spaces
-	Lux level is important=level of light
-	Occupancy hours is important
-	Check out new CIBSE guide on office lighting

# Importance of lighting design

# Types of lighting controls

Controlling lighting, whether it is old inefficient lighting or new lighting can reduce energy consumption of a lighting system.


## Types of movement sensors

There are a couple different types of movement sensors on the market, relying on movement to trigger a response. These include:
-	Passive Infra Red (PIR) sensors
-	Ultrasonic – look up
-	Microwave sensors

Passive Infra Red sensors
These are the most commonly used in commercial settings
