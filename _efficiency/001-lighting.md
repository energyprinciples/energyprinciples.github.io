# {{page.title}}

Replacing old lighting for newer, more efficient lighting is one of the most common energy efficient improvements in a building. Energy savings between 30-70% should be expected.

Benefits of looking at a new, efficient, lighting project are:

-	Energy and cost savings
-	More targeted lighting
-	Decreased lighting hours

To look at the benefits of replacing your lights, one of the first things you need to understand is how much energy you are using with your current lighting system. So, you need to understand what type of lamps you have, their wattage and how much you use them.

# Types of lamp

There are four different types of light output:

1.	[Incandescent – tungsten bulbs + halogens](#1-incandescent-lamps)
2.	[Discharge – fluorescent + metal halide etc.](2-discharge-lamps)
3.	[Induction – rarely seen, but actually quite efficient](#3-induction-lamps)
4.	[LED – very efficient](#4-led)

## 1. Incandescent lamps

Incandescnent lamps are based on electricity passing through a small filament, creating light and, as a side-product, heat.
The two most common types of incandescent lamps are tungsten bulbs and hallogens.

*Tungsten bulbs* are generally quite inefficient, wasting a lot of energy through heat. They also don't have a particularly long life span. They often darken with time, due to evaporated tungsten condensing on the inner surface of the glass. Basically, these should becomewww.theguardian.com/money/2017/aug/05/buy-to-let-landlady-13-years a thing of the past.

*Halogen lamps* contain a filament within a halogen gas, which increases the lifetime of the bulb and precents dthe darkening of the bulb. They can operate at a slightly higher temperatures and as a result are better in confined spaces and are usually qute smal in size.

## 2. Discharge lamps

There are several types of dischage lamps. Thes include fluorescent lamps, mercury vapour lamps, metal halide lamps, low pressure sodium lamps and SONs.

Compact fluorescents you often find in the home and generally consist of some sort of tube-based lamp.Common types include

Fluorescent tubes are very common in offices and work spaces. 

*instert table of typical fluorescent lamp shapes and sizes*


### Table of fluorescent tubes

Tube Name | Size
---- | ----
`T12` | `1.5 inch`
`T8` | `1 inch`
`T5` | `0.5 inch`
{: .table }

> `T5` have a higher light intensity than `T8` and need a higher heat to give best light output (lumens), and you occasionally need to heat the `T5` fitting as a result due to kinetic theory.

Fluorescent tubes have a triphosphor and a phosphor coating…
Ballasts = choke in US 
Ballasts control the electricity going in to the fluorescent tube. They often use an additional 10% of electricity on top of the lamp wattage...    can have magnetic and electronic ballasts. Electronic ballasts....

## 4. LED

LEDs are the latest rage in terms of lighting and energy efficicency, more generally.

LED is an abbreviation of Light Emitting Diode. This means that 

LEDs typically last 30,000 hours to 50,000 hours, assuming they are instaled properly. If you do get LEDs installed it might be worth requesting a warranty period that reflects the predicted lifetime of the lamp.

# Lighting controls

Controlling lighting, whether it is old inefficient lighting or new lighting can reduce energy consumption of a lighting system.


## Movement sensors

There are a couple different types of movement sensors on the market, relying on movement to trigger a response. These include:
-	Passive Infra Red (PIR) sensors
-	Ultrasonic – look up
-	Microwave sensors

Passive Infra Red sensors
These are the most commonly used in commercial settings

## Lux level sensors


# Suggested lux levels according to Building regulations, part L???

-	Office – 500 lux
-	Computer room – 300 lux
-	
If staff are getting headaches, should install a warmer colour temperature bulb – more yellow.

# Use of daylight

-	Need ownership of rooms/spaces
-	Lux level is important=level of light
-	Occupancy hours is important
-	Check out new CIBSE guide on office lighting

# Importance of lighting design



# Calculating lighting energy savings

Once you know the type of lamp you have, and you have an idea of how you would like to improve the efficiency of your lighting you can estimate what you might potentially use. 

This should involve a mixture of more efficient lighting and better control.

Calculations look at: type of lamp, wattage, number of lamps and running hours.

*Basic calculation rationale:*
1)'Current Annual Usage (kWh/year)= no. Lamps x Lamp Rating (W) x Annual Running Hours (h) / 1000'
2)'Propoesd Annual Usage (kWh/year) = proposed no. Lamps x Lamp Rating (W) x Annual Running Hours (h) * / 1000'
3)'Energy savings (kWh/year) = 1 - 2'

*Basic Lighting Energy Saving Calculator:*

Please note that the calculator above is only based on one lighting type. Realistically, most sites have several lighting types, all of which should be investigated.

Please also note that better controls should always be considered, whether increased zoning or the introduction of sensors, and this should be reflected in the Annual Running Hours.

# Common questions

## Are LEDs worth installing?

LEDs are an excellent energy efficient form of lighting. They can look great visually as well as earning you environmental brownie-points.

In reality, it is only economically worth changing your current lighting for LEDs if you use your lighting sufficiently. If you don't use your lighting that regularly you may not see a return on investment for a very long time. 

That said, LEDs can have a very long lifetime, between 30,000 hours and 50,000 hours, which may mean that they last significaltly longer than your current lighting, and this may be a good reason to install. 

Also, it depends on the total wattage of your current lamps compared to the wattage of the proposed lamps - if you double the lux level in the room through installing powerful LEDs, you might again see a long return on investment, if any at all. 

So, It is really important to look at your current lighting energy usage versus your proposed energy usage to make an informed decision.

## Are T5s still classed as energy efficient?

In short, yes. 

In more depth, T5 fluorescent lamps are XXXXXX % more efficient than T8 lamps and are XXX% more efficient that T12 lamps. Replacing T5 lamps for LEDs will reduce energy consumption in a like-for-like situation; however, this is generally not particularly economically beneficial at this point in time, because they are still relatively quite efficient.

## What do I need to consider when installing new lights

 - Is your current lighting solution suitable for the environment? Does it need to change?
 - Should you re-locate some lamps fom some areas that could do with less lighting, to areas that require task lighting?
 - Do you need to increase or decrease the lux levels in any areas?
 - Are PIR or lux level sensors suitable to be installed?
 - Do you need to change the lighting zoning? Could you improve lighting control through altering the manual switches?
 - Is there a valid reason to change lighting e.g. financial, environmental, visual or maintenance required.

## How do I install LEDs? (non technical)

Get a quote!! If you are really interested in changing your lights for LED, just aproach a couple suppliers and see what type of installation they suggest. It is important to be able to compare like-with-like, so make sure you ask them to give you the predicted energy savings and all of the assumptions used. That way you can make an informed decision.
