# {{page.title}}

Replacing old lighting for newer, more efficient lighting is one of the most common energy efficient improvements in a building. Energy savings between 30-70% should be expected.

Benefits of looking at a new, efficient, lighting project are:

-	Energy and cost savings
-	More targeted lighting
-	Decreased lighting hours

To look at the benefits of replacing your lights, one of the first things you need to understand is how much energy you are using with your current lighting system. So, you need to understand what type of lamps you have, their wattage and how much you use them.

# Types of lamp

There are four different types of lamp:

1.	[Incandescent – tungsten bulbs + halogens](#1-incandescent-lamps)
2.	[Discharge – fluorescent + metal halide etc.](2-discharge-lamps)
3.	[Induction – rarely seen, but actually quite efficient](#3-induction-lamps)
4.	[LED – very efficient](#4-led)

## 1. Incandescent lamps

Incandescnent lamps are based on electricity passing through a small filament, creating light and, as a side-product, heat.
The two most common types of incandescent lamps are tungsten bulbs and hallogens.

*Tungsten bulbs* are generally quite inefficient, wasting a lot of energy through heat. They also don't have a particularly long life span. They often darken with time, due to evaporated tungsten condensing on the inner surface of the glass. Basically, these should become a thing of the past.

*Halogen lamps* contain a filament within a halogen gas, which increases the lifetime of the bulb and prevents the darkening of the bulb. They can operate at slightly higher temperatures and as a result are better in confined spaces and are usually qute small in size. 1,700-2,500 hours lamp life.

## 2. Discharge lamps

There are several types of dischage lamp. They include fluorescent lamps, mercury vapour lamps, metal halide lamps, low pressure sodium lamps and 'SONs'.

*Compact fluorescents* you often find in the home and generally consist of some sort of tube-based lamp. Common types include:

[insert pics]


*Fluorescent tubes* are very common in offices and work spaces: 

[insert pics]

*Table of fluorescent tubes*

Tube Name | Size
---- | ----
`T12` | `1.5 inch`
`T8` | `1 inch`
`T5` | `0.5 inch`
{: .table }

> `T5` have a higher light intensity than `T8` and need a higher heat to give best light output (lumens), and you occasionally need to heat the `T5` fitting as a result.

Fluorescents lamps can have a lamp life between 10,000-45,000 hours, not including ballast life.
Ballasts = choke in US.
Ballasts control the electricity going in to the fluorescent tube. They often use an additional 10% of electricity on top of the lamp wattage. There are both electronic and agnetic types of ballast:

Magnetic | Electronic
---- | ----
`Less efficient` | `More efficient` 
`Older and can have a flicker` | `Newer and have a reduced flicker` 
`Don't like constant switching on and off` | `Better on/off control and dimmable`
`Take a while to warm up` | `0.5 inch`
`Highly affect power factor` | `Regulate power so power factor not affected`
`Cheaper` | `More expensive`
`You see a rainbow affect when you hold a mobile phone camera up to them` | `Looks normal when you hold a mobile phone camera up to them`
{: .table }

>The ballast on failed fluorescent lamps will continuously try to excite the gas and will therefore using energy!

*Metal halides* are a type of high intensity discharge (HID) lamp. They tend to have a good quality white light, close to daylight frequency, and relatively good efficiency. They can be used outside sa street lamps and football pitches as well as inside as high-bay lamps. Their main issues include cost and increased light pollution. 20,000 hourse lamp life.

*Low pressure sodium lamps* are the traditional yelowy-orange street lamp that are occasionally used indoors as well. The are energy efficiency, but have a poor Colour Rendering Index (CRI). Their lumen output does not drop with age (as LEDs and incandescents do) but sodium is flammable in air so their disposal has to be done carefully. 18,000 hours lamp life.

*SON* lamps are also called high pressure sodium lamps. The have the same yellowy-orange tinge, but have longer operational hours and are smaller in size when compared to a low pressure sodium lamp. Te ballast tends to b inneficient and affests the efficiency of the lamp. 24,000 hours lamp life.


## 3. Induction lamps

Indution lamps are not as efficienct as many of the lamps dicussed but have exceptionally long lifetimes. Induction lamps can last 60,000 hours, which is the equivalent of eight hours a day for twenty years. Therefore, if you need a lamp to last a long time due to poor access options or the requirement of long-term reliability (and LEDs are not suitable), then these might be worth looking into.

## 4. LED

LEDs are the latest rage in terms of lighting and energy efficicency, more generally.

LED is an abbreviation of Light Emitting Diode.

LEDs typically last 30,000 hours to 50,000 hours, some up to 100,000 hours depending on lamp type assuming they are instaled properly. If you do get LEDs installed it might be worth requesting a warranty period that reflects the predicted lifetime of the lamp.

# Lighting controls

Controlling lighting, whether it is old inefficient lighting or new lighting can greatly reduce the energy consumption of a lighting system, sometimes up to 80%. Getting it right can take some thought and understanding of how  an area is used to make use of the full potential of lighting controls. Here are a few things to think about and the potnetial solutions:

Situation | Potential answer
---- | ----
`Are the lights being left on unnecesarily?` | `Movement, lux or timer sensors`
`Are people frequently turning lights on and off?` | `Movement sensor`
`Are lights being left on for security or safety reasons?` | `Movement sensor`
`Is there often enough natural light?` | `Lux sensors and auto-dimmable lamps`
`Do certain lights need to be on only when its dark outside?` | `Lux sensor or timer control`
`Is a large area lit when only a small area is occupied?` | `Movement sensor or zoning with switches`
`Do you have a fancy Bulding Management System (BMS)?` | `Zoning, timers, movement sensor incorperated into a safety feature`
`Is it a corridor, store room or toilet?` | `Movement sensor`
{: .table }

Here is some more information about the controls that are available:

## Movement sensors

There are a couple different types of movement sensors on the market, relying on movement to trigger a response. These include:
-	Passive Infra Red (PIR) sensors
-	Ultrasonic
-	Microwave sensors

## Lux level sensors


### Generally suggested lux levels 

Situation | Sugested lux
---- | ----
`Office involving drawing and hand-writing` | `500 lux`
`Office mostly including computers` | `300 lux`
`Manufacturing sites` | `300-750 lux`
`Inspection areas, depending on precision` | `1000-2000 lux`
`Showrooms and retail` | `300-750 lux`
`Corridors and toilets`` | 200 lux`
`Loading bays and stores` | `100 lux`

>If staff are getting headaches, should install a warmer colour temperature bulb – more yellow.

# The importance of lighting design
If you don't have a well-thought out lighting system then you may be lighting areas that don't need to be lit and not achieving high enough lux levels where required. Key things to think about:
 - Lights should be positioned above work areas where light is needed.
 - Lights don't need to be positioned above shelves, printers, windows and doors etc.
 - You will receive more light in an area if it is directed where required i.e. not the wall.
 - If you want to create a nice ambiance with no glare then lighting a wall is nice, but not hugely efficient.
 - Lights can be lowered closer to the working area to deliver more light.
 - Natural light from windows and roof pannels should be utilised and regularly cleaned.
 
# How to calculate lighting energy savings

Once you know the type of lamp you have, and you have an idea of how you would like to improve the efficiency of your lighting you can estimate what you might potentially use. 

This should involve a mixture of more efficient lighting and better control.

Calculations look at: type of lamp, wattage, number of lamps and running hours.

*Basic calculation rationale:*

1)'Current Annual Usage (kWh/year)= no. Lamps x Lamp Rating (W) x Annual Running Hours (h) / 1000'

2)'Propoesd Annual Usage (kWh/year) = proposed no. Lamps x Lamp Rating (W) x Annual Running Hours (h) * / 1000'

3)'Energy savings (kWh/year) = 1 - 2'

*Basic Lighting Energy Saving Calculator:*

*insert here*

Please note that the calculator above is only based on one lighting type. Realistically, most sites have several lighting types, all of which should be investigated.

Please also note that better controls should always be considered, whether increased zoning or the introduction of sensors, and this should be reflected in the Annual Running Hours.

# Lighting glossary

* Lamp = the light source, often called a bulb or tube
* Luminaire = the light fitting or fixture
* Ballast = often called the choke = part of a fuorescent light. Required to produce a large current to excite the fluoro gasses on start-up and also used to regulate current an voltage to improve harmonics fo the electrical system.
* Lighting intensity (lux levels) = lighting level on a surface
* Lux = lm/m2
* Lumens = light output
* Efficacy = lumens / watts
* Light Intensity = how far the light goes
* Light density = amount that gets reflected into your eyes (cd/m2)
* Light output ratio= what you get out of the fitting
* Luminous flux = light output ratio
* Reflectance = what is reflected
* Colour temperature = a description of whether a lamp is deemed 'warm' or 'cool'. Warm = <3300 Kelvin. Cool = >5300 Kelvin. Link to Table?
* Colour Rendering Index (CRI) = accuracy by which a lamp can show surface colours. Link to table?

# Common questions

## Are LEDs worth installing?

LEDs are an excellent energy efficient form of lighting. They can look great visually as well as earning you environmental brownie-points.

In reality, it is only economically worth changing your current lighting for LEDs if you use your lighting sufficiently. If you don't use your lighting that regularly you may not see a return on investment for a very long time. 

That said, LEDs can have a very long lifetime, between 30,000 hours and 50,000 hours, which may mean that they last significaltly longer than your current lighting, and this may be a good reason to install. 

Also, it depends on the total wattage of your current lamps compared to the wattage of the proposed lamps - if you double the lux level in the room through installing powerful LEDs, you might again see a long return on investment, if any at all. 

So, It is really important to look at your current lighting energy usage versus your proposed energy usage to make an informed decision.

## Are T5s still classed as energy efficient?

In short, yes. 

In more depth, T5 fluorescent lamps are XXXXXX % more efficient than T8 lamps and are XXX% more efficient that T12 lamps. Replacing T5 lamps for LEDs will reduce energy consumption in a like-for-like situation; however, this is generally not particularly economically beneficial at this point in time, because they are still relatively quite efficient.

## What do I need to consider when installing new lights

 - Is your current lighting solution suitable for the environment? Does it need to change?
 - Should you re-locate some lamps fom some areas that could do with less lighting, to areas that require task lighting?
 - Do you need to increase or decrease the lux levels in any areas?
 - Are PIR or lux level sensors suitable to be installed?
 - Do you need to change the lighting zoning? Could you improve lighting control through altering the manual switches?
 - Is there a valid reason to change lighting e.g. financial, environmental, visual or maintenance required.

## How do I install LEDs? (non technical)

Get a quote!! If you are really interested in changing your lights for LED, just aproach a couple suppliers and see what type of installation they suggest. It is important to be able to compare like-with-like, so make sure you ask them to give you the predicted energy savings and all of the assumptions used. That way you can make an informed decision.
